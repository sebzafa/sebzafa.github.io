# Sebastian Zapata — Portfolio (scaffold)

This repository contains a minimal Next.js + TypeScript scaffold for a one-page portfolio.

What's included:
- Next.js app router (app directory)
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS configuration
- Framer Motion for scroll animations
- lucide-react for icons

Next steps (install & run locally):

1. Open PowerShell and change to the project directory:

```powershell
cd c:\sebzafa.github.io\workspace
```

2. Install dependencies:

```powershell
npm install
```

3. Start the dev server:

```powershell
npm run dev
```

The dev server will be available at http://localhost:3000

Notes:
- I did not run npm install in this environment. After installing, Tailwind will build styles automatically with Next.
- If you want additional animations or scroll-triggered behavior, I can add more advanced patterns using Framer Motion's ScrollTrigger-like utilities or a small intersection-observer helper.
